<h2> <p align="center">About Safeas Bank </h2>
<h3><b>Mission</b></h3>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At SAFEAS, our mission is to redefine the banking experience, <b>blending sustainability with modern technology and <u>cybersecurity</u></b>. We want to empower our customers with innovative financial solutions that are not only tailored to their unique needs but also safeguarded against the evolving threats of the digital age. We want to empower our customers with the opportunity of contributing to our global community - all through the means of the convinience of our banking services. We strive to deliver unparalleled service that upholds the pillars of security, transparency, and integrity.

<h3><b>Who We are</b></h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded with the vision of bridging the gap between conventional banking and the digital era, SAFEAS purchased Old Bank and is now at the forefront of financial innovation. Our foundation is built on the principles of integrity, security, and customer-centricity. This commitment is exemplified through the establishment of our proprietary Security Operations Center (SOC), dedicated to safeguarding our operations. All security matters are comprehensively addressed internally. With branches strategically located across the country, including our Main Branch, North Branch and South Branch, we ensure a seamless banking experience for every customer, whether they prefer in-person service or digital convenience.

<h3><b>Organizational Structure</b></h3>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our organizational structure is designed to support both the overarching goals of the bank and the individual security needs of our customers. The Main Branch acts as the hub for our corporate-level departments, including VIP Customer Support, IT & Digital Banking, Marketing, HR and Compliance & Risk Management. Each of these departments plays a crucial role in maintaining our high standards of security and operational excellence. Our branch-specific teams are tailored to meet the specific needs of local markets while emphasizing personalized service and security.
